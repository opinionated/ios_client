# ios_client
The iOS Client of Opinionated calls a JSON object that has all the articles in it (currently, will optimize later) and places all the articles into a tableview.


Todo:
The tableview should have multiple lines, including the title, the author, then a picture or description of the article.
Tableview should also filter article based on article tag.
